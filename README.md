## How It Works ##
Take a picture of ingredients. The Vision API will recognize these ingredients. The list of ingredients will be passed to Food2For API, which will be used to identify the best recipe with the given ingredients. The box with the name of food will appear. If this box is clicked, then the app will direct to the website containing the recipe.
